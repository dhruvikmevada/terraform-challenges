## Challenge Levels

### Beginner
1. **Deploy a Simple Web Server**
   - **Objective**: Learn the basics of Terraform by deploying a simple web server.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a Terraform configuration file to define an EC2 instance.
     - Use Terraform to provision the EC2 instance on AWS.
     - Install and configure a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on the instance.
     - Ensure the web server is accessible via a public IP address.
   - **Outcome**: A running web server that can serve web pages to the internet.

### Intermediate
2. **Deploy a Multi-Tier Application**
   - **Objective**: Understand how to create a more complex infrastructure with multiple components.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create Terraform configuration files to define a multi-tier architecture.
     - Provision at least two EC2 instances: one for the web server and one for the database.
     - Configure a load balancer to distribute traffic to the web server instances.
     - Secure the database instance by placing it in a private subnet.
   - **Outcome**: A scalable and secure multi-tier application infrastructure.

### Advanced
3. **Implement Infrastructure as Code with Modules**
   - **Objective**: Learn how to create reusable and maintainable Terraform code using modules.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Refactor the multi-tier application into separate Terraform modules.
     - Create modules for the web server, database, and networking components.
     - Use variables and outputs to manage module configurations and dependencies.
     - Ensure the infrastructure can be easily scaled and managed using the modules.
   - **Outcome**: A modular and reusable Terraform codebase that simplifies infrastructure management.

### Expert
4. **Automate Infrastructure Deployment with CI/CD**
   - **Objective**: Master the automation of infrastructure deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Integrate Terraform with a CI/CD pipeline tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
     - Automate the deployment process of the multi-tier application using the pipeline.
     - Implement automated testing and validation steps to ensure the infrastructure is deployed correctly.
     - Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place to handle failed deployments.
   - **Outcome**: A fully automated and reliable infrastructure deployment process.

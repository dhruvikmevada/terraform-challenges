# Beginner Challenge: Deploy a Simple Web Server

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to introduce beginners to Terraform by guiding them through the process of deploying a simple web server on AWS. This challenge will help you understand the basics of Terraform, including how to write configuration files, provision resources, and manage infrastructure as code.

## Project Overview
In this challenge, you will:
1. Create a Terraform configuration file to define an EC2 instance.
2. Use Terraform to provision the EC2 instance on AWS.
3. Install and configure a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on the instance.
4. Ensure the web server is accessible via a public IP address.

## Outcome
By completing this challenge, you will have a running web server that can serve web pages to the internet. You will also gain a foundational understanding of Terraform and how to use it to manage infrastructure as code.
